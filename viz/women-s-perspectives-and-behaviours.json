{"data":{"title":"Womenâ€™s Perspectives and Behaviours","desc":"Around 9% and 36% of the 882,556 users in Iraq have been classified as female and male, respectively, and the rest could not be given a gender classification. However, although the male users outnumbered the female users, the latter seemed to be more active, with an average of 112 tweets per female user, compared to 69 tweets per male user. There are some remarkable gender differences within each core grievance. Whereas men and women were tweeting mostly similar volume of content on the security and economy core grievances, when tweeting about corruption, women were more likely than men to discuss the economic cost of corruption and accountability and transparency. In terms of governance, women vocalized concerns about political fragmentation and ethnocentric divisions more than men, whereas men tweeted about legitimacy and trust in government, Iraqi identity, and discrimination and marginalization to a greater extent than women.","thumb":"emotions-across-timelines-and-twitterspheres.png"}}
